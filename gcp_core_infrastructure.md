# GCP Core Infrastructure

### Containers in the Cloud 

* __Compute__ engine :cloud::computer: is Google's __IaaS__ (Infrastructure as a service offering). We get to run VMs in cloud and also get persistent storage for them.
* __App__ engine is Google's __PaaS__ (Platform as a service offering). 
* __Kubernetes__ engine :gear: is the best of both worlds (it saves you both infrastructure and platform chores).
